## 🛰️ Project: Motion-Based Security Monitoring and Alert System

This project aims to monitor and manage specific areas using a network of devices capable of issuing alerts upon motion detection. It is composed of three main elements:

- **Physical control panel** — for user interaction with the system;
- **Monitoring devices** — responsible for surveillance and alert generation;
- **Local application** — allows for managing the network and configuring the system.

## 📟 Control Panel

### 🧠 Technologies Used

- Microcontroller: **ESP32 (ESP-WROOM-32)**
- Operating System: **FreeRTOS**
- Programming Language: **C**
- Framework: **ESP-IDF v5.3.1**
- Protocols: **Wi-Fi**, **MQTT**, **I2C**, **SNTP**
- Storage: **LittleFS**

### 🎛️ User Interface

- 0.96" OLED Display
- Push-buttons
- LEDs
- 4x3 Keypad

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Enable/disable the monitoring system.
- Display alerts and messages on the screen.
- Deactivate alerts.
- Change camera operation mode:
  - **Continuous mode**
  - **Custom mode**

---

## 🧩 Firmware Architecture

The firmware uses FreeRTOS and relies on:

- Task notifications
- Semaphores
- Queues

The architecture includes dedicated tasks for input control, display output, MQTT packet handling, timing, and signaling.

## 📡 MQTT Communication

### Topics used:

- `/sys/cam/activated/` — enable/disable monitoring
- `/sys/cam/alert/` — receive alerts
- `/syst/cam/mode/` — change camera mode
- `/sys/cam/alert/dis` — disable alerts
- `/sys/pwd/` — send or update system password

### JSON Packet Format:

| Function                           | JSON Format                                            |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Enable/disable system             | `{ "enable_system": true/false }`                     |
| Triggered alert                   | `{ "camera_id": x, "zone": "zone_name" }`             |
| Set camera mode                   | `{ "cam_mode": 1 or 2 }`                              |
| Disable alerts                    | `{ "disable": true }`                                 |
| Update password                   | `{ "new_pwd": "12345" }`                              |

> ⚠️ All packets **must be sent as strings** with **no whitespace between characters**.
